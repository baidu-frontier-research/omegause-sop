OmegaUse-SOP is a **human-in-the-loop SOP Engineering system** that transforms human demonstrations of professional computer use into reusable **SOP skills** for GUI agents.

General-purpose GUI agents perform well on open-ended computer-use benchmarks, but professional workflows are different: they depend on **domain-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs)**, software-specific conventions, implicit expert knowledge, configurable task parameters, and task-level verification. A professional workflow is not merely a long sequence of clicks — it is a trained practice.

Analogous to *prompt engineering*, **SOP Engineering** iteratively refines demonstrations, execution rules, domain knowledge, and task-specific parameters until a GUI agent can reliably reproduce a professional procedure — record once, run many times.

## How It Works

```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌───────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│ Observe  │ ──▶ │  Reason  │ ──▶ │ Configure │ ──▶ │ Execute  │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └───────────┘     └──────────┘
 Record expert    VLM abstracts    User adds         Step-wise
 operations as    low-level events domain rules &    grounding, action
 multimodal GUI   into semantic    task-specific     generation, and
 traces           instructions     parameters        verification
```

1. **Observe** — Records an expert demonstration as a multimodal GUI trace: pre-action screenshots, mouse/keyboard events, timestamps, and visual interaction targets (UI elements detected via OmniParser + PaddleOCR and cropped at the clicked position). Output: `recording.json`.
2. **Reason** — A vision-language model grounds each recorded action in its visual context and generates a step-level natural-language instruction describing the operated element, its relative position, and the intended interaction — so the agent can *locate the same target* on a future screen instead of blindly replaying a pixel coordinate. Output: `prompt.json`.
3. **Configure** — The user makes implicit expert knowledge explicit through two editable files: `domain.md` (domain SOP guidance: professional rules and software-specific execution constraints) and `params.md` (task-specific parameters: which recorded values are variables that should be replaced at run time).
4. **Execute** — Applies the configured SOP skill in a live GUI environment. To avoid context overload on long SOPs, step-related information (raw trace + semantic instruction + domain rules + parameters) is **progressively disclosed** one step at a time. Each step goes through screen grounding → action generation → low-level execution → **result verification** against the demonstration's expected post-action screen, with a human-in-the-loop option to continue, retry, or stop when a deviation is detected.

## Results

Case study on five professional photovoltaic-simulation SOP tasks in **PVsyst 7.2**, derived from real-world power-sector client workflows:

| Model | w/o SOP | w/ OmegaUse-SOP |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct | 1/5 | **5/5** |
| GPT-5.5 | 3/5 | **5/5** |
| Opus-4.7 | 2/5 | **5/5** |

Ablation: removing the **Reason** module drops Qwen3-VL from 5/5 to 2/5 — semantic abstraction of demonstrations is essential for reusable SOPs.

## Requirements

- **Windows 10/11** (the agent controls desktop applications through Windows UI automation)
- **Python 3.12** (exactly 3.12 — see [Distribution note](#distribution-note))
- An **OmniParser** server endpoint (UI-element detection for the Observe stage)
- A VLM API key for an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (default: Qwen3-VL via [Baidu Qianfan](https://qianfan.baidubce.com))

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baidu-frontier-research/omegause-sop.git
cd omegause-sop

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows

pip install -e .
pip install openai qwen-agent tqdm
```

## Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your endpoints:

```ini
# OmniParser server (UI-element detection during Observe)
OMNIPARSER_URL=http://your-omniparser-server:8000

# VLM API key (Baidu Qianfan ModelBuilder, OpenAI-compatible)
QIANFAN_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Optional overrides:

| Variable | Default | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `REASON_MODEL_NAME` / `ENRICHER_MODEL_NAME` | `qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct` | Reason |
| `REASON_API_URL` / `ENRICHER_API_URL` | `https://qianfan.baidubce.com/v2` | Reason |
| `MODEL_NAME` / `API_URL` | same as above | Execute |

## Usage

```bash
python cli_en.py
```

An interactive wizard walks you through the four stages (run them one by one, or pick **Full Pipeline**):

1. **AI Observe** — name your application and session, then perform the workflow normally. Press `Ctrl+Alt+R` to stop recording.
2. **AI Reason** — the VLM converts the recording into step-level semantic instructions.
3. **Customize** — edit `domain.md` and `params.md` (templates for PVsyst are provided in `domain_knowledge_template/`).
4. **AI Execute** — the agent reproduces the workflow on the live screen. Keep your hands off the mouse; you'll be prompted to continue / retry / stop if verification detects a deviation.

Everything for one demonstration lives in a single session directory:

```
sop/{app_name}/{session_name}/
├── screenshots/       # [observe]   pre-action full-screen captures
├── clicked_boxes/     # [observe]   cropped visual interaction targets
├── recording.json     # [observe]   low-level multimodal GUI trace
├── prompt.json        # [reason]    step-level semantic instructions
├── domain.md          # [configure] domain SOP guidance (user-edited)
├── params.md          # [configure] task-specific parameters (user-edited)
├── replay_logs/       # [execute]   execution logs per run
└── replay_temp/       # [execute]   temporary screenshots during execution
```

**SOP Engineering is iterative**: if an execution run fails, refine `domain.md` with the rule the agent missed (or adjust `params.md`) and execute again — no re-recording needed.

### Distribution note

This is an **executable demonstration package**: the CLI entry points (`cli.py`, `cli_en.py`) are provided as source, while the core modules under `agents/`, `ui/`, `utils/`, and `prompts/` are distributed as compiled CPython bytecode (`.pyc`). The bytecode is built for **CPython 3.12**, so the package must be run with Python 3.12.x (3.11 or 3.13 will not load the modules).
